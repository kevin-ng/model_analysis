# model_analysis
Code included in the book "Introduction to the Modeling and Analysis of Complex Systems" translated from Python2 to Python3.

This repository contains all codes from the book "Introduction to the Modeling and Analysis of Complex Systems" by Hiroki Sayama (sayama@binghamton.edu). The book can be freely downloaded from http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~sayama/textbook/

The original codes were written in Python 2.7.
It is now translated to Python3 using the tool "2to3" (see https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html )

The command line I used for the translation is 
"2to3 -w -n -o \<code3>  \<code>"

where \<code> is the name of the folder containing the original code,
      \<code3> is the name of the foldder containing the translated code.

I have NOT yet tested if the translation works. But the following scripts had been tested to run without syntax error in Python3:

chaotic-behavior-butterfly-effect.py
communities.py
chaotic-behavior.py
